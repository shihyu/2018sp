/*
The RDTSCP instruction reads the same TSC as the RDTSC instruction, so if RDTSC is invariant, then RDTSCP will be as well.
RDTSCP is slightly more ordered than RDTSC.  RDTSC is not ordered at all, which means that it will execute some time in the out-of-order window of the processor, which may be before or after the instruction(s) that you are interested in timing.   RDTSCP will not execute until all prior instructions (in program order) have executed.  So it can't execute "early", but there is no guarantee that the execution won't be delayed until after some subsequent (in program order) instructions have executed.
